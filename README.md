# OSCP InfoSec Notes Template

# Introduction

I have created my own Exam Notes Template inspired by Twigonometry's Template. 
His Notes Template can be found following the link below:

## Exam

We will base our structure on his template but we will modify it as needed.

Above you can see the basic structure of the exam folder which I will use during my OSCP-Exam.
## Writeups

Here I will find the write up of the machine I already pwnd and all the lessons I learned on the way.

We will use this structure for all machines we encounter.
## Projects

I should think about a structure I would like to adapt for the project folder.
At the moment it is still empty.

## To Do
